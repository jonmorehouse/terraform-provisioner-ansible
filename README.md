# terraform-provisioner-ansible
> Provision terraform resources with ansible

## Overview

**[Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform)** is a tool for automating infrastructure. Terraform includes the ability to provision resources at creation time through a plugin api. Currently, some builtin [provisioners](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/) such as **chef** and standard scripts are provided; this provisioner introduces the ability to provision an instance at creation time with **ansible**.

This provisioner provides the ability to apply **host-groups**, **plays** or **roles** against a host at provision time. Ansible is run on the host itself and this provisioner configures a dynamic inventory on the fly as resources are created.

**terraform-provisioner-ansible** is shipped as a **Terraform** [module](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/create.html). To include it, simply download the binary and enable it as a terraform module in your **terraformrc**.

## Installation

**terraform-provisioner-ansible** ships as a single binary and is compatible with **terraform**'s plugin interface. Behind the scenes, terraform plugins use https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin and communicate with the parent terraform process via RPC.

To install, download and un-archive the binary and place it on your path.

```bash
$ https://github.com/jonmorehouse/terraform-provisioner-ansible/releases/download/0.0.1-terraform-provisioner-ansible.tar.gz

$ tar -xvf 0.0.1-terraform-provisioner-ansible.tar.gz /usr/local/bin
```

Once installed, a `~/.terraformrc` file is used to _enable_ the plugin.

```bash
provisioners {
    ansible = "/usr/local/bin/terraform-provisioner-ansible"
}
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can provision resources by including an `ansible` provisioner block.

The following example demonstrates a configuration block to apply a host group's plays to new instances. You can specify a list of hostgroups and a list of plays to specify which ansible tasks to perform on the host.

Additionally, `groups` and `extra_vars` are accessible to resolve variables and group the new host in ansible.

```
{
  resource "aws_instance" "terraform-provisioner-ansible-example" {
    ami = "ami-408c7f28"
    instance_type = "t1.micro"

    provisioner "ansible" {
      connection {
        user = "ubuntu"
      }

      playbook = "ansible/playbook.yml"
      groups = ["all"]
      hosts = ["terraform"]
      extra_vars = {
        "env": "terraform"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
